“Five hours deep. Organized rituals, learned Vim, felt the pressure of income scaffolding. Named the weight, honored the pause. Still steering.”

**What are you logging today?**

Organized the archive, practiced Vim, and named the tension between ritual and revenue.  
Felt the weight of income scaffolding pressing against creative breath.  
Still chose silence over stimulation. Honored the pause, not as retreat—but as resistance.

What are you logging today?

Completed the full sweep of ValhallaBank’s emotional budget tracker.  
Every module reviewed, every prompt honored, every fragment archived in Valhalla Tracker.  
Supabase remnants identified and marked for migration. Mongo scaffolding confirmed.  
Emotional flow logged across CLI, API, and symbolic prompts.  
README, LICENSE, and changelog aligned with mythic tone.  
Phoenix is ready for UI evolution, App Store preparation, or quiet preservation.  
This is not just technical closure—it’s emotional integrity, ritual continuity, and mythic readiness.
