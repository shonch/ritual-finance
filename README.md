Ritual-Finance is more than a budget tracker—it's a tool for emotional sovereignty. Built with Python and Supabase, this project helps you log income and expenses while tagging each transaction with emotional resonance, symbolic closure, and daily intention.

Whether you're navigating financial recovery, creative rebirth, or strategic relocation, this system honors the *why* behind every dollar.
