# Rituals Directory

This space holds emotionally intelligent scripts, symbolic closures, and creative prototypes.  
Each folder reflects a zone of meaning:

- `core/`: Daily-use scripts that honor feeling and function  
- `outreach/`: Templates and trackers for emotional labor  
- `archive/`: Legacy tools and symbolic closures  
- `experiments/`: Prototypes, unfinished ideas, and playful drafts
